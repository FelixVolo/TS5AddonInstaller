## For Developers ##
If you want your addon to be compatible with the TS5 Addon Installer you need to create a new file called `addon.json` for your addon.
It marks the root of your addon source and needs to be distributed inside your addon artifact.
The `addon.json` contains the following attributes:

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| name | Specifies the name of the addon |
| id | Specifies the ID of the addon. Allowed characters: `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9` and `_` |
| version | Specifies the version of the addon, following [semver](https://semver.org/) semantics |
| inject | Specifies the file that contains the code that will be injected into the `index.html` |
| injection_point | Specifies the html tag the addon will be injected in. This can either be `HEAD` or `BODY`. Defaults to `HEAD` |
| inject_at | The position inside the html tag the addon will be injected in. This can eiter be `HEAD` or `TAIL`. Defaults to `TAIL` |
| sources | Specifies a folder relative to the `addon.json` that contains the actual source files of the addon. |
| installer | Optional: Specifies the required installer version for the addon, following [node-semver](https://github.com/npm/node-semver) semantics |
| teamspeak | Optional: Specifies the required teamspeak version for the addon, following [node-semver](https://github.com/npm/node-semver) semantics |

Example:
```json
{
	"id": "betterchat",
	"name": "BetterChat",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"inject": "index.html",
	"injection_point": "HEAD",
	"inject_at": "TAIL",
	"sources": "src/",
	"installer": "~2.0.0",
